## Terms of Reference
### 1st version
- [x] Parameters are set via text with ```triangle(x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2)``` to create a triangle and ```intersect()``` to intersect all of the triangles
- [x] The result is the visualization of the created triangles and a list of coordinates of the vertices of the figure formed by the intersection
### 2nd version
- [x] Parameters are set via text with ```polygon(x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2,...)``` to create a polygon and ```intersect()``` to intersect all of the polygons
- [x] The result is the visualization of the created polygons and a list of coordinates of the vertices of the figure formed by the intersection
